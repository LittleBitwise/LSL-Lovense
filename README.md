# Lovense Relay for Second Life

This is an LSL implementation of a "serverless" controller for a single user of Lovense Remote.

## What?
In short, this script will get the user's IP public address when they click a link* from the script. The script uses the IP and a known port to make web requests to the user's app and control the device**.

Data is sent directly from Second Life to the user, there is no other service involved in handling the requests.



\* The link points to an object within Second Life which contains this script. The URL is generated by [llRequestUrl](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlRequestURL).

\** The script is intended to be used with a single toy. Multiple toys can be used, but the same command will be sent to all connected toys.
